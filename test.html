                Hello, I am Raphaël Daubelcour, a French student currently in my second year at Isart Digital school. 
                My studies are focused on game design and development, and I am particularly interested in the technical aspect of game creation. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My goal is to become a technical game designer, using my skills and knowledge to help bring game ideas to life through programming and technical implementation.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am excited to continue learning about programming and game engine features. Recently, I started learning the C++ language and using the SFML library. I'm developing an asteroids game and a small game engine just for fun.
