                    <!-- Project Description HERE -->
                    <p>I wanted to make a multiplayer game prototype to learn more about networking, so I created <strong>League of Godot</strong>. This project is inspired by <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>
                    <p>I only recreated the characters, spells and items system for this project.</p>

                    <h2>Composition over Inheritance</h2>
                    <p>Composition is great for making modular games. The idea is to create small, reusable components.</p>
                    <p>In Godot, composition works by making scripts inherit from nodes such as <code>Area3D</code> (Trigger) or <code>Control</code> (UI), and communicating through signals. This workflow is effective because it avoids hard-coded references.</p>
                    <p>For example, I created multiple components for entities, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Health Component</b> – Manages health and life state. Key events like death or health changes are communicated via signals.</li>
                        <li><b>Health Display</b> – A 3D progress bar that visually displays the health of a Health Component.</li>
                        <li><b>Spell Manager</b> – A script that handles spell casting and cooldowns.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img class="rounded" src="projects/league_of_godot/images/composition_examples.png">
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Spells</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Godot nodes for the spell system. This allows me to manage spell data easily and assign spells to different characters.</p>
                    <p>Each spell is a node that can be added to the Spell Manager, which manages cooldowns and casting.</p>

                    </video>
                    <p>All spell data is exposed in the editor, so I can easily tweak values like damage and target types.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Items</h2>
                    <p>I implemented an item system inspired by <em>League of Legends</em>. Items can be purchased in the shop. The example below shows an item that gradually increases movement and attack speed over time.</p>

                    </video>
                    <p>Here's the code for the item (in C#):</p>
                    <pre class="code"><code>using Godot;

public partial class DoranSword : Accessory
{
    private float _speedBonus = 0;

    public override void OnHit(Entity entity, Entity damager)
    {
        entity.HealEntity(100);
    }

    public override void Tick(Entity entity, float delta)
    {
        _speedBonus += delta;
        entity.BonusMoveSpeed += _speedBonus;
        entity.BonusAttackSpeed += _speedBonus;
    }
}</code></pre>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Networking</h2>
                    <p>The game uses a dedicated server architecture. Each player is a client; the server has authority over the game world, while the clients have authority over player inputs.</p>
                    <p>Using a dedicated server helps prevent cheating and makes it easy to deploy on cloud platforms.</p>
                    <p>I'm using Godot's multiplayer system. Inputs are sent using RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls).</p>
                    <p>Items, spells, and inputs are automatically synced with the server. I only need to manually sync special interactions like Mordekaiser’s ultimate.</p>

                    <h2>What Did I Learn?</h2>
                    <p>This project was a wonderful experience — but not without its challenges! Here are a few things I would do differently:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Use a state machine</b> – It would have made character state management much cleaner.</li>
                        <li><b>Spend less time on visuals</b> – I spent too much time on character models and animations, which weren’t essential for a prototype.</li>
                        <li><b>Networking is hard!</b> – I got it working, but network traffic is heavy, up to 60KiB/s at peak. That doesn't sound like a lot but I only had 2 characters inside my scene and no game logic was implemented.</li>
                        <li><b>And finally...</b> If you made it this far, it means you were interested enough to read the entire page — and for that, thank you!</li>
                    </ul>
